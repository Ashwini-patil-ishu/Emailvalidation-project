REGULAE EXPRESSION:-
Regular Expressions or Regex is an API for defining String patterns that can be used for searching, manipulating, and editing a string in Java. Email validation and passwords are a few areas of strings where Regex is widely used to define the constraints. Regular Expressions are provided under java.util.regex package. 
In order to check that an email address is valid or not, we use the below-given regular expression provided in the  Validation Regex repository.
^[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-] + (?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]
+ )*@(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.) + [a-zA-Z]{2, 7}$
